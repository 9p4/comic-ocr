# Comic OCR

This is a simple Python program to extract text from comics so that I can search for specific comics easily. So far, I have written an extractor for [SMBC Comics](smbc-comics.com). The data will be made available with a search engine online later.

## Requirements
- Tesseract OCR
- Python
- OpenCV
