# Comic OCR

This is a simple Python program to extract text from comics so that I can search for specific comics easily. So far, I have written an extractor for [SMBC Comics](smbc-comics.com). ~~The data will be made available with a search engine online later.~~ The data is available to use right now [here](https://9p4.github.io/comic-fulltext-search) and the repo is [here](https://github.com/9p4/comic-fulltext-search).

## Requirements
- Tesseract OCR
- Python
- OpenCV
